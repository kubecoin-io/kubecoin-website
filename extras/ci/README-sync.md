# Upstream Sync Guidance

This document provides guidance for syncing with upstream repositories and
maintaining consistency across the kubecoin-website project.

## Overview

The upstream sync process ensures that our project stays aligned with upstream
changes while maintaining our customizations and configurations.

### Sync Process

1. First, check the current status of your repository
2. Create a backup of your current changes
3. Pull the latest upstream changes
4. Resolve any merge conflicts
5. Test the updated configuration
6. Commit and push the resolved changes

### Prerequisites

Before starting the sync process, ensure you have:

    - Git configured with proper credentials
    - Access to the upstream repository
    - Local development environment set up
    - Backup of current configuration files

### Common Issues

When syncing with upstream, you might encounter:

    - Merge conflicts in configuration files
    - Breaking changes in dependencies
    - Updates to build processes
    - Changes in directory structure

### Resolution Steps

1. Review all conflicts carefully before resolving
2. Test changes in a development environment first
3. Update documentation to reflect any changes

#### Configuration Management

Handle configuration files with extra care during sync:

- Always backup current configurations
- Document any custom modifications
- Test configuration changes thoroughly
- Update related documentation

#### Testing Procedures

After completing the sync:

- Run all existing tests
- Verify website functionality
- Check build processes
- Validate deployment procedures

#### Post-Sync Validation

Ensure the following after sync completion:

- All tests pass successfully
- Website builds without errors
- All custom features work correctly
- Documentation is up to date

### Best Practices

- Always create a branch for sync operations
- Document all changes made during sync
- Test thoroughly before merging to main
- Keep detailed logs of sync activities

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during sync:

- Check the project logs for error details
- Review upstream changelog for breaking changes
- Consult team documentation for known issues
- Seek assistance from team members if needed
